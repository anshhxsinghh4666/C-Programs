// DYNAMIC MEMORY ALLOCATION : It is a way to allocate memory to a data structure during the runtime

// Compile Time Memory Allocation-> Time when the C compiler is running and analysing the memory requirements
// Run Time Memory Allocation -> Time when the code is running i.e the time between the start and end of the programe

// We need some functions to allocate & free memory dynamically


// Functions For DMA : 
//     -> malloc() ~ stands for memory allocation [Required Library to use malloc() -> <stlib.h>]
//     -> calloc() ~ stands for continous allocation
//     -> free()
//     -> realloc() ~ stands for reallocation
