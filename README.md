# ðŸ’» C Programming â€“ Learning, Revision & Projects

This repository is a complete collection of my C programming practice, built for **learning**, **revision**, and **building logic**. It combines content from:

- ðŸ“º [Apna College C One-Shot](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irqbmMNs2Bo)
- ðŸ’¡ Important coding questions for logic building
- ðŸ§ª Lab assignments from my college
- ðŸš€ Small C-based projects

Itâ€™s structured for quick revision before exams, practice during lab sessions, or brushing up C fundamentals before moving on to C++ or DSA.
